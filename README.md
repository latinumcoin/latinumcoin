What is Latinumcoin?
----------------

Latinumcoin is an experimental new digital currency based off of BitCoin that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Latinumcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Latinumcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Latinumcoin Core software, see http://www.latinumcoin.org/

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Latinumcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
